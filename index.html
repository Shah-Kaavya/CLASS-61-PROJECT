            I love playing badminton with my friends.Badminton is an indoor game that is played with a lightweight racket and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock was a small cork with a hemisphere with 16 geese that was attached and weighing about 5 grams. Badminton requires practice and precision. My arms feel heavy after a long session, but I love how strong I feel afterwards. If someone would suggest to play badminton the whole day I can do that also!! Badminton is a sport that makes me feel active and healthy while having fun. It is the source of my energy. Playing this sport makes me feel strong and confident.
